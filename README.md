# Decentralized Data Economy Glossary

## ACDC

Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDC)

ACDC is a transient storage component that contains a bundled payload consisting of data claims, key event provenance, schema objects, and exchange rules in a cryptographically verifiable format.

## TDA 
Trusted Digital Assistant (TDA)

TDA is a human operating system for a dynamic data economy (DDE), which allows users to manage personal event identifiers and data objects with consent, enabling decentralised interactions with other entities and services. It is a set of cross-platform applications for managing digital assets, including exchanging, proving, and verifying claims.

## MSP
Meaningful Service Providers

## OCA
Overlay Capture Architecture

OCA presents a schema as a multi-dimensional object consisting of a stable capture base and interoperable overlays. Overlays are task-oriented linked data objects that provide additional colouration to the capture base.

Decentralized Identifier
## KERI
Key Event Receipt Infrastructure

KERI is an architecture that compiles key event logs to record universal self-certifying proofs of the binding between self-certifying identifiers (SCID) and public/private key pairs.

## SSI
Self-Sovereign Identity
## ~~DRI~~

Decentralized Resource Identifiers

replaced by SAI - Self-Addressing Identifier

## Microledgers

A Microledger is an event transaction log that is cryptographically bound to a self-certifying identifier (SCID), enabling auditable account details of the origin, changes to, and details supporting the confidence or validity of data.

## ~~DSH~~

Data Sharing Hub see Data Sharing Engine

## DSE

Data Sharing Engine
DSE is a search engine that uses interoperable semantic overlays as the underpinning for criteria searches on structured, harmonised data for meaningful research, insights, and analytics.

## DGE

DGA is a multi-stakeholder collaborative or consortium working for a common purpose, industry sector, or jurisdiction that facilitates safe and secure data sharing on behalf of the citizens and legal entities it serves. All DGAs contain a data sharing engine (DSE) target that domain experts can monitor to protect members against unethical or sensitive incoming data requests.
