# Decentralized Data Economy Glossary

## Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDC)

[ACDC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ssmith-acdc/) is a transient storage component that contains a bundled payload consisting of data claims, key event provenance, schema objects, and exchange rules in a cryptographically verifiable format. 

## Trusted Digital Assistant (TDA)

TDA is a human operating system for a dynamic data economy (DDE), which allows users to manage personal event identifiers and data objects with consent, enabling decentralised interactions with other entities and services. It is a set of cross-platform applications for managing digital assets, including exchanging, proving, and verifying claims.

## Authentic Data Container (ADC)

ADC is a file format (.adc) which carry on accurate data.

## Data Authenticity

Data authenticity refers to the quality of digital data which ensures that data has not been corrupted (integrity) after its creation and can be attributed (authenticity) to a source or origin. Data authenticity is crucial for establishing veracity.

## Decentralised Key Management System (DKMS)

A “Decentralized Key Management System” (DKMS) is an approach for generating, distributing and managing cryptographic keys. DKMS is network-less which means it doesn’t need to use any specific network at all (can work peer-to-peer) or network-portable which means that its keys are not locked to any given network or provider and may switch as needed. Main task of the DKMS is to provide a discoverability mechanism for keys and assuring the integrity and authenticity of the keys.

## Dynamic Data Economy (DDE)

The Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) refers to a paradigm where accurate data can flow within or across different digital ecosystem. It enables secure exchange across variouse governance and stakeholders, including individuals, organizations, and systems. Data flows dynamically in the Dynamic Data Economy, maintaining integrity, authenticity, and data governance. This concept promotes innovation, efficiency, and new business models based on the seamless integration and utilization of data in a trusted manner.

## Data Insights Providers

Role within MMM which provides service enriching data within given ecosystem.

## Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA)

OCA presents a schema as a multi-dimensional object consisting of a stable capture base and interoperable overlays. Overlays are task-oriented linked data objects that provide additional colouration to the capture base.

## OCA Bundle

An "OCA Bundle" refers to a collection of objects that conform to Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA). OCA bundle is a snapshot without history of the OCA Objects. It is used as a consumable unit for capturing and representing data semantics. 

## OCAFile

“OCAFile” refers to a file format containing Domain Specific Language, specifically designed to allow humans for seamless creation of OCA Objects conforming to Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA). 

## OCA Repository

"OCA Repository" (or "OCA Repo") refers to a centralized or distributed storage system specifically designed for storing, retrieving and management of Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) artifacts, which include Capture Bases, Overlays, Bundles and OCAFiles.

## Semantic Repository

A “semantic repository” is a system build on top of OCA repository adding autenticity layer for semantic objects. It serves as an interface for structured and interconnected semantic information which can accessed and queried in control way.

## Purpose based services (PBS)

Role within MMM which provides service in digital economy.

## Blinding Identity Taxonomy (BIT)

The [BIT](https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/Blinding-Identity-Taxonomy-Report-Version-1.0.pdf) is a taxonomy of data fields to be blinded for the purpose of removing identity data
from a dataset.

## Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)

[Key Event Receipt Infrastructure](https://keri.one/)  is the first truly fully decentralized identity system.
KERI is an architecture that compiles key event logs to record universal self-certifying proofs of the binding between self-certifying identifiers (SCID) and public/private key pairs.

## Microledgers

A Microledger is an event transaction log that is cryptographically bound to a self-certifying identifier (SCID), enabling auditable account details of the origin, changes to, and details supporting the confidence or validity of data. Microledger serves as a tamper-resistant record of transactions, providing transparency and accountability within a defined context. 

## Distributed Governance Authority (DGA)

Is a role in MMM, which is a multi-stakeholder collaborative or consortium working for a common purpose, industry sector, or jurisdiction that facilitates safe and secure data sharing on behalf of the citizens and legal entities it serves. All DGAs contain a data sharing engine (DSE) target that domain experts can monitor to protect members against unethical or sensitive incoming data requests.

## Self-Certifying Identifier (SCID)

A [Self-Certifying Identifier](https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-keri/draft-ssmith-keri.html#name-self-certifying-identifier-) is uniquely cryptographically derived from the public key of an asymmetric keypair, (public, private). It is self-certifying in the sense that does not rely on a trusted entity.

## Self-Addressing Identifier (SAID)

A [SAID](https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-said/draft-ssmith-said.html) (Self-Addressing IDentifier) is a special type of content-addressable identifier based on encoded cryptographic digest that is self-referential.

## Transaction Event Log (TEL)

The Transaction Event Log is a set of transactions that provide cryptographic proof of the registry state. 

## Master Mouse Model (MMM)

The Master Mouse Model is a economical model which separates data collection from data enrichment providers, controled by Decentralized Governance Authority
